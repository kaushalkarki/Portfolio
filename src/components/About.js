        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
        I hold a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture & Technology, where I built a strong foundation in computer science principles, software engineering, and problem-solving. During my time there, I actively engaged in projects, internships, and leadership roles, further refining my technical expertise and collaboration skills.
        Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics from Kumaun University, Nainital. This interdisciplinary background has honed my analytical thinking, logical reasoning, and structured problem-solving approach, which I apply daily in software development.

        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>
        With over 3 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I have honed my skills in backend and full-stack development, specializing in Ruby on Rails, React.js, and scalable API architectures.
        At Maropost, I played a pivotal role in designing, developing, and optimizing RESTful APIs, ensuring high performance, security, and scalability. I spearheaded efforts to enhance database efficiency, reducing query execution time by 40%, and implemented robust RSpec test suites to maintain 90%+ test coverage. My contributions in code reviews, architectural decisions, and AI-powered integrations significantly improved product quality and business efficiency.
        As a React Intern at Grey Scientific Labs, I built modular, reusable frontend components, improved state management, and optimized application performance for a seamless user experience.
        My experience has taught me the importance of writing clean, maintainable code, collaborating in cross-functional teams, and continuously learning to stay ahead of industry trends.
